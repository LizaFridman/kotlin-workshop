/**
 * Create a top-level constant for the maximum number of books a person could borrow.
 *
 * Inside the Book class, create a method canBorrow() that returns true or false
 * depending on whether a user has already borrowed the max number of books.
 *
 * Create a Constants object that provides constants to the book.
 * For this example, provide the BASE_URL for all books in the library catalog.
 * Inside Book, add a method printUrl that creates and prints a URL composed of BASE_URL,
 * the book title, and “.html”.
 *
 * The base URL is really of interest to the Book class.
 * As such, it makes sense to limit its scope to the Book class.
 * Use a companion object to define the constant in Book.
